                    <br>
                    <h3>In fact, we have a lot of problems.</h3>
                    <p><b>No matter where you are in America, chances are you are experiencing real adversity.</b></p>

                    <p><b>The economy is not working for all of us.</b> Families from California to Maine are struggling
                        to put food on the table, pay for medical expenses, and afford a quality education. As the
                        wealthiest Americans reap benefits from the stock market, it never seems to trickle down to the
                        bottom 95% in the form of higher wages and job security. The rise of income inequality, offshoring,
                        and automation has created disenfranchised Americans in both the cities and the farmlands.</p>

                    <p><b>The school system is not working for all of us.</b>
                        A quality education is determined more and more by your zip code. The wealthy can move and pay
                        for the finest K-12 and secondary schools in the world, while underpaid teachers in underfunded
                        communities must somehow teach a crowded room of children with different skills and challenges.
                        National politicians on both sides don't understand that only 33% of kids go to college, because
                        college isn't for everybody.</p>

                    <p><b>The healthcare system is not working for all of us.</b> Beyond the fact that the wealthiest nation
                        in human history can't seem to afford x-ray exams to every citizen, a false stigma has also been
                        created. Our healthcare isn't <b>health</b>care- it's <b>sick</b>care. Instead of proactively
                        offering our citizens affordable healthy food options, safe-sex products, and mental health support,
                        we hastily (and expensively) try to fix a snowball of damage.</p>

                    <p><b>The social state of America is not working for all of us.</b> Bigotry, racism, and misogyny run
                        ramped in a world that welcomes the spread of disinformation. Social media platforms and establishment media are major
                        causes of this, as the free market pushes us towards a more polarized state of affairs. On Facebook,
                        it is financially in one's best interest to spread an ad or agenda that affirms fringe beliefs on their
                        side rather than one that reaches across the aisle with thoughtful, data-driven arguments.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>Let's cut to the chase. All these issues boil down to a single root cause; <b>there are too
                        many Dakotas.</b></h3>
                    <p>Think about it... during all your problems, what was the constant? North and South Dakota were
                        two states in our democratic union.</p>

                    <p><b>As President of the United State, I will call for the dissolution of North and South Dakota
                        into one state, aptly named "Dakota". It's not North. It's not South. It's Dakota</b></p>

                    <h3>Our New Nation</h3>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-8">
                            <img src="images/Our%20New%20Map.png" class="img-responsive"/>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <br>
                    <p>The Dakotas have had too much power for too long, and they know it. Since their founding in
                        1889, the citizens of the Dakotas found a way to double their governing power and infiltrate the
                        integrity of our democracy. They have been drunk with power for too long, and it's time too stop
                        them. Here is a convincing infographic that proves my point:</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-7 col-md-10">
                            <img src="images/California-vs-Dakotas.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Dakota Pledge will drastically shift Dakota's voting power overnight. By combining North and
                        South Dakota, the new state of Dakota will have a combined citizenship of 1.6 million
                        people. Nebraska, an honorable state that is about that size, has five electoral votes. Thus, we will
                        drop Dakota's electoral power from six votes to five. That leftover vote will be transferred to the
                        USA's fastest-growing state, Idaho. Yes, I'm am surprised as well! Way to go, Idaho!</p>

                    <p>The next time your family is sitting around the kitchen table, I want you to consider one thing:
                        "Do the citizens of North and South Dakota have my best interests in mind?" The answer is
                        simple: no. As you wonder about your children's future, Dakotan elites sit in a smoke-filled room-
                        wondering how they can expand their empire even more. The problems of today are not spawned by Mexicans,
                        Muslims, Jews, or the Dutch; I blame the Dakotans. I trust the data.</p>

                    <p>I want to make something abundantly clear; I do not hate people from Dakota. I just love the people
                        from every other state a lot more. As President, I will fight tooth and nail for all who want to play
                        fair and live an honest life. I can assure you that my candidacy is not spawned by ego; in fact, I will
                        be the last President who would want to be on Mount Rushmore.</p>

                                        Combining North and South Dakota will make our country have 49 states instead of a rounded 50. How will you address this?
                                    </button>

                                    Valid question. My think-tanks and I do concede that North and South Dakota help give
                                    America that simple, satisfying 50 stars on the flag. But as President, I promise not
                                    to solve one problem and create 49 more. After enacting The Dakota Pledge, I also
                                    promise to give statehood to Washington D.C. I am also open to Puerto Rico becoming
                                    a state, but I think everyone agrees we can only accept one. Consider this the beginning
                                    of a healthy dialogue.

                                    Sort of. Way back in the late 1800s, the majority of Dakotans were found in one of
                                    two population centers. Given the limited infrastructure and commerce between the
                                    two areas, policymakers saw it fit to create two states. These variables are now a
                                    thing of the past, and a dissection of powers provide no utility towards the American
                                    spirit of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. To those that say "Why split up
                                    the Dakotas?" I say, "Why not?"

                                    According to Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution, “New States may be admitted
                                    by the Congress into this Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected within
                                    the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two
                                    or more States, or Parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the
                                    States concerned as well as of the Congress.”
                                    <br><br>
                                    In other words, as long as the Dakotas and U.S. Congress are cool with this proposal,
                                    this can really happen. Obviously, the 96 senators from the other states will be down.
                                    In order to get the Dakotas on board, I was thinking we could market The Dakota Pledge
                                    in an admirable light. What if Dakota's nickname became: "Big Dick-ota"? The slogans
                                    write themselves.
